## User
I am learning OOP in python. I have the following class defined:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self,name,age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.__person_dict = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return "{"+f"\'name':{self.name},'age':{self.age}"+"}"
    
    def dicionary(self):
        self.__person_dict['name'] = self.name
        self.__person_dict['age'] = self.age
```
When I define the object p2 and a dicctionary for it, as defined in the class code:**

p2 = Person("Maite",25)
dict_p2 = print(p2.dicionary())

And then I try to print the dictionary and its type:**

print(dict_p2)
print(type(dict_p2))

I get None and NonType as a type. Why? What am I doing wrong when I define the dictionary as a method inside the class?

## Bing
The issue you're encountering lies in the way you've defined your dicionary method within the Person class. Let's break it down:
- In your dicionary method, you're modifying the __person_dict attribute by adding the name and age as key-value pairs. However, you're not returning anything explicitly from this method.
- When you call p2.dicionary(), it executes the method, but since there's no explicit return statement, Python implicitly returns None.
- Consequently, when you assign the result of print(p2.dicionary()) to dict_p2, you're actually assigning the return value of the print function, which is also None.
- That's why when you subsequently print dict_p2, you see None.
To fix this, modify your dicionary method to return the dictionary instead of printing it. Here's an updated version of your class:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.__person_dict = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return "{" + f"'name': {self.name}, 'age': {self.age}" + "}"

    def dicionary(self):
        self.__person_dict['name'] = self.name
        self.__person_dict['age'] = self.age
        return self.__person_dict  # Return the modified dictionary
```
Now, when you create an instance of Person and call the dicionary method, it will return the dictionary containing the name and age. You can use it like this:
```
p2 = Person("Maite", 25)
dict_p2 = p2.dicionary()  # Assign the returned dictionary
print(dict_p2)
print(type(dict_p2))
```

This should give you the expected output without any None values. üòä

## User
Could you give me an equivalent code to the code above in the procedural programming paradigma?

## Bing
Certainly! Below is an equivalent code snippet in procedural programming style that achieves the same functionality as your original class-based code:
```
def create_person(name, age):
    person_dict = {'name': name, 'age': age}
    return person_dict

def main():
    # Example usage
    p2_name = "Maite"
    p2_age = 25
    dict_p2 = create_person(p2_name, p2_age)

    print(dict_p2)
    print(type(dict_p2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**In this procedural approach:**
- We define a function create_person that takes name and age as arguments and constructs a dictionary with those values.
- The main function demonstrates how to use create_person to create a dictionary for a person named "Maite" with an age of 25.
- Running the script will print the dictionary and its type, just like your original class-based code.
Remember that procedural programming focuses on organizing code into functions and procedures, rather than using classes and objects. üòä

## User
i don't really understand the need of the 'self' word. it's something that i'm mostly using by learning it by heart than actually understanding why its presence is needed there. Can you give me an simple explanation for 'absolute dummies', please?

## Bing
Certainly! Let's demystify the concept of self in Python. Imagine you're in a room with a mirror. ü™û
- **The Room and the Mirror:**
    - The room represents a class you've defined.
    - The mirror reflects an instance of that class (an object created from it).
- **The Self-Reflection:**
    - When you're in the room (inside a method), you want to refer to yourself (the instance).
    - You say, "Hey, mirror! Tell me about my name and age."
    - In Python, we use self to refer to the instance (the mirror).
- **Why Not Just Use "Me"?**
    - Well, Python doesn't have a magical way to know which instance you're talking about.
    - So, you explicitly say, "Mirror (self), show me my name and age!"
    - It's like saying, "Hey, self, tell me your secrets!"
- **The Convention:**
    - By convention, we use self as the first parameter in instance methods.
    - But you could technically call it anything (like me, this, or even banana).
    - However, everyone uses self, so it's like a secret handshake among Python developers.
- **Instance Variables:**
    - When you create an instance (look in the mirror), you can have your own attributes (variables).
    - For example, your mirror might have a name and an age.
    - You use self.name and self.age to access these attributes.
- **Mirror, Mirror on the Wall:**
    - The mirror (instance) holds your personal information (attributes).
    - When you call a method (like asking the mirror to show your name), you need to pass the mirror (instance) as the first argument (that's self).
    Remember, self is just a way to talk to the mirror (instance) and access your own stuff (attributes). It's like saying, "Hey, instance, tell me about yourself!" ü§ó
    Now go forth and reflect upon your Python objects! üêçü™û.

## User
I think I don't get the meaning of instance here and hence, as your explanation is based on that, I don't really understand why we are using a mirror in the room :(

## Bing
No worries! Let's break it down further. Imagine you're in a magical room with a mirror. ü™û
- **The Room and the Mirror:**
    - The room represents a class you've defined in Python.
    - Think of the class as a blueprint or a template for creating objects.
- **Creating an Object (Instance):**
    - When you want to create something from that blueprint, you stand in front of the mirror and say, "Mirror, mirror, create an object!"
    - The mirror (class) then magically creates an object based on the blueprint.
    - This object is like a clone of the blueprint, with its own unique characteristics.
- **Attributes and Behavior:**
    - Now, this magical object has its own attributes (like your name and age).
    - It also has behaviors (methods) that it can perform (like saying hello or calculating something).
    - You can access these attributes and behaviors through the object.
- **Talking to the Mirror (Using "self"):**
    - When you're inside the room (inside a method), you want to talk to the mirror (object).
    - You say, "Hey, mirror (object)! Tell me your name and age."
    - In Python, we use the special word self to refer to the object (mirror).
- **Why "self"?**
    - Python doesn't know which object you're talking about unless you explicitly say it.
    - So, you say, "Mirror (self), show me your secrets!"
    - self is like a secret code that connects you to the right mirror (object).
- **Instance vs. Blueprint:**
    - The mirror (object) is an instance of the blueprint (class).
    - Each time you create an object, you're making a new instance.
    - The mirror reflects the specific characteristics of that instance.
- **In Summary:**
    - The mirror (object) is your magical creation based on the blueprint (class).
    - You use self to talk to the mirror (object) and access its attributes and behaviors.
    Remember, the mirror (object) is your unique reflection of the blueprint (class). And self is your way of saying, "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the most Pythonic of them all?" ü™Ñüêç

## User
What is the mirror supposed to be reflecting in your explanation? Why is it needed in the room?

## Bing
Certainly! Let's demystify the concept of self in Python without the mirror analogy. üêç
- **Blueprint and Instances:**
    - Imagine you're an architect designing houses. You create a blueprint (class) for a house.
    - Now, you want to build actual houses based on that blueprint. Each house is unique.
    - In Python, the blueprint is the class, and each actual house is an instance of that class.
- **Creating an Instance:**
    - When you say, "Build a house!" (create an instance), Python follows the blueprint.
    - It allocates memory and sets up the house (instance) with its own attributes (like rooms, color, etc.).
- **Talking to the House (Using "self"):**
    - Inside the house (a method), you want to refer to specific things within that house.
    - You say, "Hey, house (instance)! Tell me your color and number of rooms."
    - In Python, we use self to refer to the specific house (instance).
- **Why "self"?**
    - Python doesn't magically know which house you're talking about.
    - So, you explicitly say, "House (self), show me your secrets!"
    - self connects you to the right house (instance).
- **Instance vs. Blueprint:**
    - The blueprint (class) defines the structure and behavior.
    - Each house (instance) follows that blueprint but has its own unique features.
- **In Summary:**
    - The house (instance) is your actual living space.
    - You use self to access your room, kitchen, and other parts of the house.
    Remember, self is like a GPS that guides you within your house (instance). No mirrors needed! üòä

## User
So, does 'self' equate to "this object that I am creating now" or that is newly created, whichever in each case?

## Bing
Certainly! Let's clarify the role of self in Python:
- **self Represents the Current Instance:**
    - When you create an object (instance) from a class, self refers to that specific instance.
    - It's like saying, "Hey, I'm talking about this object right now!"
- **Creating Objects:**
    - Imagine you're a cookie cutter (class) for making cookies (instances).
    - Each time you stamp out a cookie (create an object), it's a unique cookie with its own flavor (attributes) and taste (methods).
- **Talking to the Cookie:**
    - Inside the cookie (a method), you want to refer to specific chocolate chips (attributes) within that cookie.
    - You say, "Hey, cookie (instance)! How many chocolate chips do you have?"
    - In Python, we use self to refer to the specific cookie (instance).
- **Why "self"?**
    - Python doesn't know which cookie you're talking about unless you explicitly say it.
    - So, you say, "Cookie (self), show me your chocolate chips!"
    - self connects you to the right cookie (instance).
- **Instance vs. Class:**
    - The cookie cutter (class) defines the shape and recipe.
    - Each cookie (instance) follows that recipe but has its own unique chocolate chips.
- **In Summary:**
    - self is like a nametag that says, "Hello, I'm this cookie!"
    - It ensures you're interacting with the right cookie (instance).
    Remember, self is your way of saying, "I'm talking about this cookie, not the others!" üç™üêç

## User
Can yo come up with an example of a class that, because not using the word 'self', nor any other instead, would not work correctly but python would not through any error message, as a way of ilustrating the need of using self inside classes?

## Bing
Certainly! Let's explore an example where omitting self inside a class method would lead to unexpected behavior. Imagine we have a simple class called Person:
```
class Person:
    def set_name(name):
        self.name = name

    def greet():
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}."

# Create an instance of Person
p = Person()

# Set the name
p.set_name("Alice")

# Try to greet
print(p.greet())
```

Now, let's break down what's wrong here:
- **In the set_name method:**
    - We're trying to set the name attribute of the instance.
    - However, we forgot to include self as the first parameter.
    - Without self, Python won't know which instance's name attribute to set.
- **In the greet method:**
    - We're trying to access the name attribute to create a greeting.
    - Again, we forgot to include self.
    - Without self, Python won't know which instance's name to use in the greeting.
- **The Result:**
    - When we run this code, Python won't throw an error.
    - Instead, it will create a global variable named name (not tied to any instance).
    - The greeting will fail because self.name doesn't exist.
    To fix this, we need to add self as the first parameter in both methods:**
```
class Person:
    def set_name(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}."

# Create an instance of Person
p = Person()

# Set the name
p.set_name("Alice")

# Greet successfully
print(p.greet())
```

Now, with self, Python knows which instance's attributes to work with. The corrected code will greet us as expected:

Hello, my name is Alice.

Remember, self is like a magic wand that connects you to the right instance within your class! ü™Ñüêç

## User
And what if we just did this:
```
class Person:
    def set_name(name):
        return name

    def greet():
        return f"Hello, my name is {name}."

# Create an instance of Person
p = Person()

# Set the name
p.set_name("Alice")

# Try to greet
print(p.greet())
```

## Bing
In the modified code snippet, you've removed the self parameter from both the set_name and greet methods. Let's analyze what happens:
- **set_name Method:**
    - Without self, the method doesn't know which instance's name attribute to set.
    - When you call p.set_name("Alice"), it won't set the name attribute for the instance p.
    - Instead, it will create a global variable named name (not tied to any instance).
- **greet Method:**
    - Similarly, without self, the method can't access the name attribute.
    - When you call p.greet(), it will fail because self.name doesn't exist.
    - It will raise an error like: NameError: name 'name' is not defined.
- **The Result:**
    - The code will not work as expected.
    - It won't greet with the correct name, and you'll encounter an error.
    To fix this, make sure to include self as the first parameter in both methods:

```
class Person:
    def set_name(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}."

# Create an instance of Person
p = Person()

# Set the name
p.set_name("Alice")

# Greet successfully
print(p.greet())
```

Now it will greet correctly:

Hello, my name is Alice.

Remember, self is essential for connecting methods to the specific instance they belong to! üêç

## User
But in the example I've given to you where the self word was omitted on purpose, when I run the code in my computer, the error it throws is: *Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/francisco/Documents/Learning/PUE/Python/Ejercicios/Edube/Module2/classes1_with_errors.py", line 12, in <module>
p.set_name("Alice")
TypeError: Person.set_name() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given.*
Why is the interpreter saying that I have given two positional arguments if I have only writen one in p.set_name("Alice")? Unterstanding the meaning of this error I think it would help me understanding the importance of the presence of the 'self' word

## Bing
I apologize for any confusion. Let's dive into the error you encountered and understand why it happened.
The error message you received is:

*TypeError: Person.set_name() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given.*

**Here's what's happening:**
- You defined the set_name method inside the Person class without including the self parameter explicitly.
- When you call p.set_name("Alice"), Python internally translates it to Person.set_name(p, "Alice").
- The method expects only one argument (the name), but Python automatically passes two arguments: p (the instance) and "Alice" (the name).
- Since the method doesn't explicitly accept two arguments, Python raises a TypeError.
Now, let's see how adding self as the first parameter solves this issue:

class Person:
    def set_name(self, name):
        self.name = name

- **Create an instance of Person:**
  - p = Person()

- **Set the name:**
  - p.set_name("Alice")

- **No error, and the name is set correctly:**
  - print(p.name)

In this corrected code:
- The self parameter in the set_name method ensures that the method knows which instance's name attribute to set.
- When you call p.set_name("Alice"), Python correctly associates it with the instance p.
- The error is resolved, and the name is set as expected.
Remember, self is essential for connecting methods to the specific instance they belong to. Without it, Python doesn't know which instance you're referring to! üêç

## User
Ok, let's pretend that I am discovering how to create objects by myself. Nobody has told me yet about the existence of the magical word 'self' that will refer to any object I create, not just 'p' (correct me please if what I'm now writting is conceptually wrong). So, not knowing how to refer to any object to call that 'any object' name's property, how would i sort out that issue in that particular case? (remember that we are pretending that I haven't heard of the word 'self' anywhere yet). Would it be something like:

```
class Person:
    def set_name(p,name):
        return name

    def greet():
        return f"Hello, my name is {name}."

# Create an instance of Person
p = Person()

# Set the name
p.set_name("Alice")

# Try to greet
print(p.greet())
```

## Bing
Certainly! Let's explore how you might approach this without prior knowledge of the magical self keyword. In your example, you're trying to create a Person class and set its name. However, there are a couple of issues:
- **Missing self Parameter:**
    - When defining methods inside a class, you need to include the self parameter as the first argument.
    - This parameter refers to the specific instance (object) of the class.
- **Accessing Attributes:**
    - To access attributes (like name) within a method, you need to use self.name.
    - Without self, Python won't know which instance's attribute to use.
    Let's correct your code step by step:

```
class Person:
    def set_name(self, name):
        # Set the instance's name attribute
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        # Access the instance's name attribute
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}."

# Create an instance of Person
p = Person()

# Set the name
p.set_name("Alice")

# Try to greet
print(p.greet())
```

Now, with the addition of self, your code will work as expected:

Hello, my name is Alice.

Remember, self is the magical link that connects methods to the specific instance you're working with! ü™Ñüêç

## User
Lool at this simple example given in w3schools.org when they start explaining OOP: They start creating a class here like:
```
class MyClass:
x = 5
```
Then they create a class and call the attribute x:
```
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
```
It works. Why can't classes be as simple as that, that I need to use define methods and use self inside them?
## Bing
The example you've mentioned from [w3schools.org]() is indeed a simple demonstration of a class. Let's break it down:
- **The Simple Class:**
    - In their example, they define a class called MyClass.
    - Inside this class, they have an attribute x with the value 5.
- **Creating an Instance:**
    - They create an instance of MyClass using p1 = MyClass().
    - This instance is like a container that holds the attributes defined in the class.
- **Accessing the Attribute:**
    - When they print p1.x, it correctly displays the value of x (which is 5).
    Now, let's address your question about why classes often involve methods and the use of self:
- **Attributes vs. Methods:**
    - Attributes (like x) are simple data stored within an instance.
    - Methods are functions associated with the class that can perform actions or computations.
    - While simple classes with only attributes exist, methods allow classes to do more interesting things.
- **Why Methods?**
    - Classes become powerful when they can perform actions beyond just storing data.
    - Methods allow you to define behavior associated with the class.
    - For example, a Person class might have methods like greet(), calculate_age(), etc.
- **The Role of self:**
    - self is a reference to the current instance (the container).
    - It allows methods to access and modify the instance's attributes.
    - Without self, methods wouldn't know which instance they're working with.
- **Example with Methods:**
    - Let's enhance our MyClass with a method:

```
class MyClass:
    x = 5

    def double_x(self):
        return self.x * 2

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.double_x())  # Prints 10
```

In summary, while simple classes with only attributes exist (like the one from w3schools), methods and self allow classes to be more dynamic, interactive, and capable of performing actions beyond basic data storage. üêç

## User
What am I missing if I don't use def Init: to define an atribute, but x = 5 instead? Is it that, this way I can't give specific attributes to the many different objects I wish to create from that class later on?

## Bing
When you create a class in Python, you have the option to define an __init__ method (constructor). Let's explore the implications of using or not using __init__:
- **Using __init__:**
    - When you define an __init__ method, it runs automatically when you create an instance (object) from the class.
    - You can set specific attributes for each instance during its creation.
    - This allows you to customize each object with unique initial values.
- **Not Using __init__:**
    - If you don't define an __init__ method, Python still creates instances without any issues.
    - However, all instances will share the same class-level attributes (like x = 5).
    - In other words, every object created from the class will have the same initial value for x.
- **Example:**
```
class MyClass:
    x = 5

# Create two instances
obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

# Modify obj1's x
obj1.x = 10

# Print both x values
print(obj1.x)  # Prints 10
print(obj2.x)  # Prints 5
```

- **Customization:**
    - If you want different instances to have different initial values (attributes), use __init__.
    - With __init__, you can customize each object's state during creation.
    In summary, using __init__ allows you to create more flexible and customized objects, while not using it results in instances that share the same initial attributes. Choose based on your specific needs! üêç

## User
acording to the latter, in the following code:
```
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__stack_list = []


    def push(self, val):
        self.__stack_list.append(val)


    def pop(self):
        val = self.__stack_list[-1]
        del self.__stack_list[-1]
        return val


stack_object = Stack()

stack_object.push(3)
stack_object.push(2)
stack_object.push(1)

print(stack_object.pop())
print(stack_object.pop())
print(stack_object.pop())
```
To create a stack through creating objects, can I skip the init: function and just write stack_list = [] to make every object start with an empty list that will later on filling with the push method?

## Bing
Certainly! Let's discuss the implications of skipping the __init__ method and directly initializing an attribute outside of it.
In your original code, you have the __init__ method that initializes the __stack_list attribute to an empty list when you create an instance of the Stack class. This ensures that every object starts with an empty stack.
However, if you choose to skip the __init__ method and directly initialize the __stack_list attribute outside of it (like stack_list = []), here's what happens:
- Class-Level Attribute:
    - When you define an attribute directly in the class (outside any method), it becomes a class-level attribute.
    - Class-level attributes are shared by all instances of the class.
    - In your case, stack_list would be the same for all Stack objects.
- Shared State:
    - If you create multiple Stack objects, they will all share the same stack_list.
    - Any changes made to stack_list in one object will affect all other objects.
- Example:
```
class Stack:
    stack_list = []  # Class-level attribute

    def push(self, val):
        self.stack_list.append(val)

    def pop(self):
        val = self.stack_list[-1]
        del self.stack_list[-1]
        return val

stack_object1 = Stack()
stack_object2 = Stack()

stack_object1.push(3)
stack_object2.push(2)

print(stack_object1.pop())  # Prints 2 (because stack_list is shared)
```
- Conclusion:
    - While this approach works, it's not ideal for maintaining separate state for each instance.
    - Using __init__ allows you to create unique attributes for each object.
    - If you want each stack to have its own independent list, stick with the __init__ method.
In summary, skipping __init__ and directly initializing class-level attributes can lead to shared state among instances. For independent state, use __init__ to set instance-specific attributes. üêç
